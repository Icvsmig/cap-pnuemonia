# cap-pnuemonia

I will be trying to detect pneumonia in patients using X Ray images so that pneumonia treatments can start sooner, especially for patients with severe conditions. I am building a Convolutional neural network to detect pneumonia in X rays of the patients. 

This model can help Radiologists make accurate decisions sooner and help them save time which as we know is very precious when it's a matter of human lives. A similar model can also be constructed  for COVID-19 patient’s X-rays. 

The data is available on Kaggle and I will use libraries such as Pillow, keras preprocessing to load access the images. 

I will be using image processing techniques to extract the information that I will need to accomplish the project’s agenda. I will use Scikit image submodule skimage to filter images, numpy to mask images,  Pillow to manipulate images, and opencv.
I might use Grid search cv to tune the hyperparameters if the model performance is substantially improved over time required. 
I will use accuracy and val accuracy to evaluate the model performance. 

I think image processing will be one of the toughest parts of the project because I have not yet worked with Images. Even though we worked with unsupervised learning models but understanding and implementing CNN will be a tough task because we did not cover that in our Thinkful modules.
